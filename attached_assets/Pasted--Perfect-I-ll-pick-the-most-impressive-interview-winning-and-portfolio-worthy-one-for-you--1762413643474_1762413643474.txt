## 🎨 **User Journey (Core UX Flow)**

| Step | User Action                 | System Response                                                       |
| ---- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Opens app                   | “Hello, where would you like to go today?” (Voice + text)             |
| 2    | User says “Hospital”        | Detects nearest hospital, confirms with big “Start Navigation” button |
| 3    | App speaks clear directions | Simple arrows + large progress bar                                    |
| 4    | Mid-route reassurance       | “You’re on the right path, 500m to turn.”                             |

## 💰 Monetisation & Retention

### Monetisation:

1. **Freemium Model:**

   * Free basic routes
   * Premium: “Family Link” (relatives can track trip progress)
2. **Partnerships:**
   Tie-ups with health & mobility brands (wheelchairs, pharmacies)

### Retention Loop:

* Weekly “confidence scores” (how many trips completed safely)
* Gamified “Safe Miles” streak (gentle, positive reinforcement)
* Family notifications (“Dad reached home safely”) encourage long-term use

---

## 📈 Metric to Track

**Primary Metric:**
➡️ *“Trip completion rate per active user”*
Measures trust + usability — the most critical success signal for this audience.

**Secondary Metric:**
➡️ *% of users enabling Family Link (retention indicator)*

---

## 🚀 Growth & Impact

* Word-of-mouth through families and senior communities
* Can integrate with existing GPS APIs (Google Maps SDK + custom voice layer)
* Potential government tie-ins for elderly safety

---

## 🧑‍💻 Next Step (Prototype)

I’ll now design a **clickable high-fidelity prototype (Figma)** showing:

* Home screen (large text, “Where do you want to go?” voice UI)
* Active navigation screen (clear arrows + voice prompts)
* Family link page

---

Before I create it:
Would you like the prototype to look like a **mobile app** or a **smartwatch/voice-assistant interface** (like Alexa for elders)?

👉 Choose **“mobile app”** (easier to present) or **“voice-first interface”** (more innovative).
